    "story": "Hello! My name is Matheus Silva, and I am a Full Stack Developer from Brazil, whose passion for programming began at the age of 12. Initially, my involvement with technology was casual, working with PHP and WordPress until I was 16.<br></br><br></br>It was at that age that I decided to seriously focus on my career, transitioning to the JavaScript ecosystem, where I specialized in tools such as React, NextJs, and NodeJs. This focus allowed me to develop innovative and scalable solutions, transforming complex ideas into impactful digital products.<br></br><br></br>Today, at 25, my career is a reflection of my commitment to innovation and technical quality. I continue to explore new technologies and methodologies to improve the systems I develop, always with the goal of exceeding market expectations. Outside of work, I am passionate about single-player games, eclectic music, and traveling, which enrich my life with new experiences and perspectives."
